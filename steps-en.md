â†“ Request to GitHub Copilot

```
This is a web application development project.
We want to create a TODO application.

The features are as follows:
- Display TODO list
- Add TODO
    - Ability to input task content and deadline
- Change TODO to completed status
    - Mark as completed by turning on the checkbox
    - Add strikethrough to completed TODOs

We want to use Tailwind CSS.
https://tailwindcss.com/

The implementation will be done using Agent-type AI tools.
You should divide the implementation tasks in a way that is easy for the AI Agent to understand.

The output should be prompts for each task.
Since these are prompts for AI Agent requests, please provide specific work instructions.

At the end of each task, please instruct to update .junie/guidelines.md according to the changes.
```

## Task 2: Todo Model and Repository Implementation

```
Please implement the data model and repository layer for the Todo application.

1. Create the `Todo` entity class:
   - id: Long (primary key)
   - title: String (TODO content)

   - completed: Boolean (completion flag)
   
2. Create the `TodoRepository` interface extending JpaRepository:
   - Basic CRUD operations
   - Custom query methods for retrieving completed/incomplete TODOs
   
Please implement with code examples.

After implementation, please review the entire project and update the information in `.junie/gudelines.md`.
```

## Task 3: Service Layer Implementation

```

## Task 4: Controller Implementation

```
Please implement the controller layer for the Todo application.

1. Create the `TodoController` class and implement the following endpoints:
   - `GET /`: Display the main page and list all TODOs
   - `POST /todos`: Create a new TODO
   - `POST /todos/{id}/toggle`: Toggle the completion status of a TODO
   - `DELETE /todos/{id}`: Delete a TODO (optional)
   
2. Ensure proper integration with Thymeleaf templates.
3. Define form objects for POST requests.

Please provide complete code examples.

After implementation, please review the entire project and update the information in `.junie/gudelines.md`.
```

## Task 5: Thymeleaf Templates and Frontend Implementation

```
Please implement the frontend of the Todo application using Thymeleaf and Tailwind CSS.

1. Create a main page in `src/main/resources/templates/index.html` with the following elements:

     - Completed TODOs should have a strikethrough on the title
   - A form to add new TODOs
     - Title input field
     - Date picker for deadline selection
     - Submit button
   
2. Style the UI using Tailwind CSS:
   - Responsive design
   - Modern and clean layout
